## Streaming List Tracker

A simple PHP/MySQL app to keep track of movies, shows, franchises, or anything you're currently watching.

### Setup

1. Create a database called `streaming_list` and import the schema from `schema.sql`.

2. Edit `config.php` and fill in your database connection info.

3. Place all the PHP files in the same directory (like `index.php`, `details.php`, etc). Make sure `styles.css` is there too.

Thatâ€™s it. You should be able to open `index.php` in your browser and start adding stuff.

If you run into any issues, double check your DB config or file permissions.
